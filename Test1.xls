> 
>   
>   
> Two mass shootings in two days in Serbia, where such tragedies are rare, have sent the country and surrounding Balkan region into a state of shock.
> 
> Late on Thursday, at least eight people were killed and 14 wounded after a 21-year-old suspect in a moving car opened fire on passers-by in a town south of Belgrade.
> 
> A day earlier, a 13-year-old suspect carried out an attack that officials say he had planned for months, killing eight of his schoolmates and a security guard.
> 
> On Friday, waking up to the news of the drive-by attack, Serbia entered an official three-day mourning period to pay tribute to Wednesday’s child victims.
> 
> “There will be justice. These monsters will never see the light of the day, neither the little monster nor the little older monster,” President Aleksandar Vucic said, as he deplored Thursday’s “terrorist attack” and proposed tough new gun controls.
> 
> In a sombre national address, President Vucic, wearing a dark suit, said the gunman had been wearing a T-shirt with neo-Nazi symbols.
> 
> He gave no further details about the shootings.
> 
> Vucic proposed a moratorium on gun permits regardless of weapon type, in what he called a “practical disarmament” of Serbia that would also include more frequent medical and psychological checks of gun owners.
> 
> The government would also hire 1,200 new police officers to improve security in schools, he said.
> 
> Vucic added that he had proposed the reintroduction of the death penalty but said the government was against such a step.
> 
> In Serbia, the president is largely a ceremonial figure but Vucic wields considerable power as he also heads the ruling party.
> 
> ## Deadly drive-by attack
> 
> Thursday’s shooting took place near Mladenovac, a town 50km (30 miles) south of the capital Belgrade.
> 
> The state-run RTS television said the suspected gunman first opened fire at a schoolyard in the village of Dubona and killed a police officer and his sister, along with others in the area.
> 
> He then moved on to the nearby villages of Mali Orasje and Sepsin, according to RTS.
> 
> “We heard gunshots in the evening, but I thought it was fireworks, children fooling around. It did not even occur to me that something like this could happen,” Zvonko Mladenovic, a Dubona resident, told the AFP news agency.
> 
> The suspect was on the run for hours before police arrested him early Friday, RTS reported.
> 
> The police said the man had been arrested near the central city of Kragujevac and about 90km (56 miles) from the scene of the attacks.
> 
> According to RTS, the suspect was arrested at the home of a relative and was in possession of four hand grenades and a large number of illegal weapons and ammunition.
> 
> Serbian officials including Vucic and Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic have cast the shooting as “a terrorist act”.
> 
> Al Jazeera’s Bojana Stojanovic, reporting near Mladenovac, said the heavy police presence eased after the suspect was arrested.
> 
> “People felt relief after news of the arrest,” she said.
> 
> “We are all in a state of shock, people have still not captured their emotions after the school tragedy.
> 
> “Everyone is a bit more silent than they were. The loudest thing we can hear is shock. These things never happened in Serbia before, not in this measure.”
> 
> ## State of mourning
> 
> In the [shooting rampage](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/3/school-shootout-kills-one-injures-five-in-serbias-belgrade) at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade, the 13-year-old suspect used his father’s guns.
> 
> One of the victims, a child, was a French citizen, France’s foreign ministry said.
> 
> Earlier on Thursday, dozens of students, many wearing black, paid their respects.
> 
> People cried and hugged outside the school, still cordoned off by police, as they stood in front of heaps of flowers, small teddy bears and footballs.
> 
> The Balkans is among the top regions in Europe in the number of guns per capita and Serbia is awash with weapons left over from the wars of the 1990s.
> 
> Still, the country has strict gun laws and mass shootings are rare – the last was in 2013 when a war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village.
> 
> [People comfort each other at a memorial for those killed in a mass shooting at a Belgrade school.](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23124246727136-1683253389.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513)The latest shooting took place as Serbia mourned a mass shooting by a 13-year-old pupil at a primary school in central Belgrade [Armin Durgut/AP Photo]Authorities on Thursday moved to further tighten gun control and police urged citizens to lock up their weapons and keep them away from children.
> 
> Police have said the teenage attacker planned Wednesday’s attack for a month, drawing sketches of classrooms at the school and compiling lists of the children he planned to kill.
> 
> One girl who was shot in the head remains in a life-threatening condition, while a boy is in serious condition with spinal injuries, doctors said on Thursday.
> 
> The school shooting suspect has not given any motive for his actions.
> 
> Experts have repeatedly warned of the dangers posed by the number of weapons in a highly-divided country like Serbia, where convicted war criminals are glorified and violence against minority groups often goes unpunished.
> 
> They add there is also a risk from decades of instability stemming from the conflicts of the 1990s as well as ongoing economic hardship.
> 
> “We have had too much violence for too long,” psychologist Zarko Trebjesanin told N1 television. “Children copy models. We need to eliminate negative models … and create a different system of values.”

282,"> If you start your ""state"" by forcibly moving 700k people 

You have some really logical points there, but you start off by this propaganda fueled lie and I really suggest you to learn past what your local Muslim Free Palestine group at your college campus has taught you.

The truth is that the vast amount of Arabs moved on their own, their leaders have called for them to leave as they believed their neighbors will come to help them, real quote: ""Annihilate the Jews"" and then to return. Young Israel did not have any capabilities of doing such a thing much less so in the midst of a war with about 7 invading armies. That is completely ridiculous.

I am not saying nothing bad happened, things sure did as they always do in a total war (Started by the Arab world, important to mention). But the vast majority of these people have fled or fought (And lost).

On the contrary, the Palestinians who decided to stay on the designated borders of Israel and declared their peaceful intentions, got fair rights and today make over 20% of Israelis.

Which is exactly why the apartheid claims are so silly. When over 20% of Israelis ARE Palestinians enjoying completely equal rights including political parties (One was a part of the last coalition for example), supreme court judges, work with us, study with us, etc...

Watch this very short old historical doco bit: https://twitter.com/YosephHaddad/status/1604345764439785472

Now, tell me, do you know what happened to Jewish communities in the West Bank after the UN partition plan? Let's just say ""Ethnic Cleansing"" which so many ignorants like to attribute to Israel, actually did happen. Just not to the side you're thinking about.","Apartheid claims are not ridiculous.   If you start your ""state"" by forcibly moving 700k people and preventing them from returning--- then have a military occupation over where they got crammed  (sure they pulled out of Gaza eventually) and economic blockade and no right to self-govern --- I mean there's something to be debated at the very least.  It's not the very same thing than what happened in South Africa, clearly, but parallels were drawn.

I am also not saying that the Palestinian Islamists in power aren't hostile.  They are.  And the problem is that because they feel pressured they  keep turning to complete dickheads to represent them which isn't helping their cause.  If Israel pulls out of Palestine it'll be like USA pulling out of Afghanistan with the Taliban taking over and just driving the country in a shithole.

And Palestinian refugees in other Arab countries apparently are treated even worse, even if those were the countries that technically backed them.  Like in Egypt where they were never really helped or given citizenship either.  So it's not like those pro-Palestine neighboring countries are doing anything to help either other than dunk on Israel

It's just one big great shitpie.  The ideal scenario would be to let Palestinians have their own nation and not be occupied and for Israel to be left alone peacefully but I don't know how that's going to happen with the current forces in power.  Perhaps if they managed to elect some leaders that weren't Islamists but people tend to turn to religious fundamentalist and nationalist views when they're under duress.

> Sadly a risk of hoaxing is always possible. I saw one commenter mention **the original TikTok poster is a computer graphics artist**, which adds another tricky element to be considered.


I believe it is obviously most likely CGI. This would be the craziest shit ever if it isn’t CGI. Show me the evidence of CGI though, I’m not married to this TikToker. We all want a better understanding of truth. 

I am just stating what we know - and not what a lot of folks like to pretend to know better. If you’re a pro graphics guy, you could take the time to educate people about the telltale giveaways of altered footage. Someone who cares about this subject and has that skill set will. I said before this isn’t my forte. I am trying to explain why just spouting off, *it is also insanely fake CGI* is no less agnostic than OP saying *it is a UFO on the moon*. 

I guess I appreciate your opinion but I just wish you could help people like me know how to tell the difference. I’m still very open to the notion that UFOs could perhaps be some gigantic confusion of human psychology or something, despite most of the stuff I’ve studied nearly eliminating that possibility. I know hoaxes are very real and problematic. I know the community is easy to fool because of our eagerness. But man this stuff is Wild West, uncharted shit - no one is going to know what a spaceship might look like or move like or how it would interact with camera sensors, bend light, etc. Who on earth knows what a “real UFO” might behave like and render on our technology. There’s all kinds of science we’re just scratching dealing with electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics. That kind of tech with fields, polarization, and all this stuff I know zero about - we do know can cause weird effects on cameras and sensors. We can imagine this advanced stuff (and still undiscovered stuff) might be utilized by a more technologically advanced “other”. 

I just can’t believe people pretend to know everything when there’s clearly not a consensus reality on this subject. Hence, fascination by millions paying attention… and minor annoyance at those who get off being the smart and logical know-it-all kids in the playground. I think those people need to eat a scary amount of mushrooms and remember that we’re living in a goddamn mystery machine lol.

371,">“routine internal complaints of disgruntled employees.”

""everyone I've wronged says that about me... no big deal.""","**From reporters Isaac Arnsdorf and Beth Reinhard:**  
Matt Schlapp, the prominent Trump ally who leads the influential Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), was accused this week of mismanaging money and staff in a scathing resignation letter from the parent organization’s treasurer.  
  
Bob Beauprez, the treasurer of the American Conservative Union and a board member for eight years, said he had “lost confidence” in the organization’s financial statements and could not solicit donations “in good faith.” He blamed Schlapp for excessive staff departures and suggested that violations of the organization’s bylaws could expose the storied institution to lawsuits or even criminal prosecution.  
  
“A cancer has been metastasizing within the organization for years. It must be diagnosed, treated, and cured, or it will destroy” the organization and its foundation, Beauprez said in the letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post. “I’ve come to think that the expectations for my role as a director and officer is much the same as that of a mushroom — ‘To be kept in the dark and fed a lot of manure.’ I no longer am willing to comply.”  
  
The 13-page letter, delivered Tuesday ahead of a scheduled June 1 board meeting, escalates the internal and public pressure on Schlapp, who as ACU chairman since 2014 has become a fixture in conservative media. But his leadership is facing multiple challenges amid corporate backlash over CPAC’s embrace of the far right in the U.S. and abroad, as well as reduced turnout at its flagship Washington-area conference in March. Schlapp called the event a “Home Run.”  
  
Schlapp and his wife, Mercedes, a senior fellow at the foundation and a former senior official in the Trump White House, are also fighting a defamation lawsuit from a former Republican campaign aide who alleged that Schlapp groped him last fall during a visit to the Atlanta area. Schlapp, 55, has denied the aide’s account and attacked his credibility.  
  
Schlapp on Thursday broadly denied the allegations in the letter, characterizing them in a response posted to Twitter as the “routine internal complaints of disgruntled employees.”  
  
“The claims contained in the original email are out of context or are in error,” Schlapp said. “I’ve experienced a political assassination attempt on every part of my character and integrity for the past five months. I’m disgusted that I need to respond to the Post about internal deliberations of CPAC - an organization that’s grown five-fold under my leadership.”  
  
Beauprez did not respond to a message from The Post.

After Jan 6, what is the fucking call? Justice. We want Trump and his fucking seditious insurrectionists to be hemmed up for his bullshit.

On Jan 6 it was Trump supporters who beat the shit out of cops to attempt a coup. Is this something you support? Of course not. Every rational American wants justice for that sedition. 

Hell; Black Lives Matter is an *appeal* for justice. Black people are sick of being gunned down by police extrajudicously, ie, outside of justice. BLM is an *appeal* for justice; treat black people the way you do white people. We matter. Stop treating us like we don't, right?

Keep in mind that, most people *aren't* ACAB. Being anti-cop isn't a winning play. There are good cops and bad cops. What makes a good cop a good cop and a bad cop a bad cop?

Shooting black people extrajudiciously? Bad cop. Selling fucking fentanyl as head of the police union? Bad cop. Indicted Texas AG fighting the law he's supposed to uphold? Refusing to face justice for his crimes? Bad cop.

570,"The truth is there is no *birth right citizenship* for the children of immigrants, illegal or not, nor for visitors to this country.  The left always ignores the specific part of the 14th Amendment that states

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

The law was written to ensure children of freed slaves were citizens.  As the slaves had no home land they were fully **subject to the jurisdiction** of the United States.  Immigrants and visitors are not, they are all citizens of their respective home countries and subject to their jurisdiction.

The left, as usual, likes to play games and claim that the phrase applies to everyone in our borders because they're all required to obey our laws, so that makes them *subject to the jurisdiction** but that is crap.   Everywhere you go in the world you are required to obey local laws.   Here's a practical example.

The United States today taxes the income of US citizens who live and work overseas, they are all required to file tax returns.  Many other nations do the same thing.

Now, an immigrant (legal or illegal) working in the United States is also required to file tax returns in the US if they earned an income.  That is no different than a person living in Florida having to file tax returns in New York if they did business there.   

But if that same immigrant leaves the US, goes to another country or goes back to their home country, because they are not truly *subject to the jurisdiction* of the US, the US can **not** tax them any longer.  This is exactly why 14th specifically did not apply to the *Indians non-taxed* who actually lived inside the US borders, they were considered *subject to the jurisdiction* of their tribal nation.  Congress had to pass legislation many years later to grant them citizenship upon birth.  No such legislation exists regarding existing non-citizens (legal or illegal).  No child born in the US who doesn't have at least one biological parent that is already a US citizen becomes a US citizen due to birth.

So where the article says 

>Trump said. ""From all over the world they came. Under Biden's current policies even though these millions of illegal border crosses have entered the country unlawfully, **all of their future children will become automatic U.S. citizens**. Can you imagine?

The subpoena sought the records for deals reached since 2017, when Mr. Trump was sworn in as president.
> 
> The Trump Organization swore off any foreign deals while he was in the White House, and the only such deal Mr. Trump is known to have made since then was with a Saudi-based real estate company to license its name to a housing, hotel and golf complex that will be built in Oman. He struck that deal last fall just before announcing his third presidential campaign.
> 
> The push by Mr. Smith’s prosecutors to gain insight into the former president’s foreign business was part of a subpoena — previously reported by The New York Times — that was sent to the Trump Organization and sought records related to Mr. Trump’s dealings with a Saudi-backed golf venture known as LIV Golf, which is holding tournaments at some of his golf clubs. (Mr. Trump’s arrangement with LIV Golf was reached well after he removed documents from the White House.)

> Collectively, the subpoena’s demand for records related to the golf venture and other foreign ventures since 2017 suggests that Mr. Smith is exploring whether there is any connection between Mr. Trump’s deal-making abroad and the classified documents he took with him when he left office.

Look it's an unprecedent crossroads in Pakistan. The military leadership wants one thing and an overwhelming majority of the population another. That includes retired and current military families.

The military has shown they will resort to all sorts of violence, and have continued to push blocks on most social media sites even now. Garbage journalism continues to underreport many of these issues in Pakistan, the Guardian being one of the worst examples.

So what's going to happen? It's anyone's guess. To me just look at the population, average age is low 20s. An entire generation is angry, sees no economic future with massive corruption, and now also experienced violence from these political dynasties and military. They won't forget it.

The DOJ had already interviewed some of the people. Others couldn't be interviewed yet due to constitutional issues, which the DOJ has now resolved.

This was never a danger. We know this now with certainty because it *didn't* happen in places where they didn't engage in foolhardy mass lockdowns. The difference between various places for addressing COVID was almost entirely related to demographics - obesity, age distribution, etc. - not policy.

Indeed, we knew *before* COVID that a mass quarantine was idiotic. The science was settled that quarantines only work on a small scale because large-scale quarantines are invariably incomplete. That's why when COVID started they were very careful to state it was a temporary measure to gather more information and prevent hospital overloading.

The real reason we ended up with long-term mass quarantine is that the people who were making those decisions were insulated from the consequences of obeying them. Either they simply ignored them as suited them - as happened with the wealthy/powerful - or they were able to continue their lives from home.","COVID emergency orders are among `greatest intrusions on civil liberties,' Justice Gorsuch says",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-justice-covid-emergency-restrictions-85401feb29bea6db2f2ea4ac61cdeff2,reddit,jkwtspw,"[[True, 201], [False, 1041], [True, 1014], [True, 135], [True, 77]]"

Here's the comprehension :

He clearly made a demand, but not in official proposal format, government clarified, he says he making it into one.

All under bjp government

So, what exactly was the point of bjp backing again?
Go on, answer this and my previous question if you dare.


Edit :

More clarification from wakf :


>The leaders said that they had made this demand before the elections. “It must happen for sure. It was our demand before the elections itself. It must be fulfilled. We are only asking for a Deputy CM to be the Muslim. Ideally, it should be a Muslim CM because Karnataka has never had one in its history, and 90 lakh people in the state are Muslims. We are the largest minority community apart from the SCs. We didn't get the 30+ seats we wanted. But we at least want five Muslim ministers like during SM Krishna's period and now a Deputy CM. That's what we want,"" he said.

>The party pledged to reinstate a 4% reservation for Muslims, which was abolished by the previous BJP government. Of the 15 Muslim candidates fielded by the Congress, nine have won the state assembly elections.

I'll agree, that seems like a fairly important thing for a military transport aircraft to do, but it's replacement can carry 17 additional tonnes; also an important thing for military transport aircraft to be able to do (especially now we are looking at fighting peers at scale compared to the COIN and nation building of the past two decades).  
 It's also not exactly fair to compare an airframe which has had more than two decades to mature (just counting the J variant) to one the RAF first flew in 2014; Of course the newer plane is going to be down for maintenance more; people haven't figured out how to do it the best way as they have with the Herculeses yet. In fact, how far do we have to look ahead to see the Hercules airframes aging out? (this isn't rhetorical, I'd genuinely like to know) because if they get too old, they'll stop being one of the most reliable airframes in the fleet and turn into a 35 tonne albatross that needs a constant supply of expensive spares and life extensions.   
My point is, they will need replacing at some point, so why not do it now when they can be sold rather than scrapped, and there's plenty of time to get used to its replacement? Yes, there are some shortfalls, but even though I'm not military or a pilot, I reckon it's probably easier to bodge a plane so you can drop a RHIB out the back than it is to find another 17 tonnes of cargo capacity and 20 years of service life on an airframe.","UK will be left 'dangerously exposed' when it cuts fleet of special forces aircraft, sources say",https://news.sky.com/story/uk-will-be-left-dangerously-exposed-when-it-cuts-fleet-of-special-forces-aircraft-sources-say-12881389,reddit,jk95xw1,"[[False, 120], [False, 52], [False, 136], [False, 152], [False, 1057]]"

>Why should Texas have to bear the brunt of all the people coming over?

Texas doesn't have to bear all of the brunt. The federal government already moves people to different cities and areas within the US, including Chicago, and provides a ton of funding. They plan it out to prevent any area from becoming overwhelmed. For example, FEMA has hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for this purpose; none of that money has been provided to Chicago.

I think that a lot of the whole charade with Turkey's accession process has to do with domestic priorities more than anything else. Pandering to voters who may be racist is not the same thing as being hypocritical and racist yourself, (especially when a lot of those voters are likely among the most Eurosceptic to begin with). 

And while your view is admirable, the EU and people within it need to decide what they want the EU to be before such expansion is possible. Whether they want it merely to be a powerless set of lateral agreements providing some convenience with travel and data roaming, or an actual multi-ethnic community that goes beyond nations.

As it stands, I think you'll struggle to find many people other than yourself who are ""European"" first and whatever nation is second, rather than the other way around.","We ARE a bunch of racist hypocrites, but the EU is better than the alternative, which is not being in the EU

1681,"Well, the Syrian government - the Syrian Arab Republic - is the legal sovereign in this case and internationally-recognized government of the country. I don't believe it's legal or acceptable for regional Arab and Turkish Islamists or the minority liberal faction or Western liberals in North America and Europe to support an insurgency and attempted takeover of another foreign sovereign country by proxy just because they want to spread their ideology abroad by the sword and believe they will be able to gain geopolitical advantage by doing so (that they will be able to puppetize it if they can get people they support to seize control). 

This against a country which didn't attack any of them, wasn't about to or attempting to, and didn't even threaten to. To me, that's therefore a war of aggression, the supreme crime by the Nuremberg standards from which all subsequent resulting crimes derive.

But I'm a fervent supporter of and believer in the Westphalian system of state sovereignty. For full disclosure, I was staunchly against any attempts to topple the Syrian government ever since March of 2011, but if a domestic faction actually managed to do so of their own accord with zero foreign backing, then that's ultimately an internal affair. Just as in Afghanistan. The Sunni Islamist Pashtun tribalists in the Taliban/IEA have what is close to the worst ideology on Earth from my vantage point, but they came to power by their own will, means, and accord. Their country, their business.","To me, this is an arbitrary standard. The Assad regime also received vast amounts of foreign backing. Was that legitimate just because Assad has a seat at the United Nations?

Most of history's important revolutions depended on foreign support to achieve victory. That makes sense, because the state usually starts out with an overwhelming superiority in organization and weaponry. Expecting every country with a UN seat to be an isolated, self-contained little world that nobody interferes in is an unrealistic standard of sovereignty.

The case is also considered among the weakest of the cases that the DA could have brought, and most consider it unlikely to lead to any substantial punishment even if he's found guilty on all counts, largely because nobody wants to deal with the logistical and political nightmare that would come with attempting to jail a former President.  

* Merrick Garland has been shown to be afraid of his own shadow.  There is absolutely no reason to believe he intends to file charges in the foreseeable future, and Jack Smith doesn't exactly have his foot on the gas either.  

* Georgia just passed a law allowing Kemp to remove prosecutors from office for whatever reason he sees fit.  All indications are that this bill was passed as a direct result of Fani Willis and her investigation into Trump's election interference, and any attempt at actually charging Trump with a crime will lead to her removal by Kemp and the investigation subsequently squashed.  

And even if you're still optimistic enough to believe that Trump will eventually see some form of punishment, remember:

* He's been out of office for 2.5 years now, and has still not seen any punishment for his decades of crimes.
* Despite being charged with over 30 felonies, he was not handcuffed.  He was not perp-walked.  No mugshot was taken.  He was able to negotiate the terms of his own arrest and surrender.  
* Despite being charged with over 30 felonies, he's still allowed to travel around the world in his own private jet unimpeded.

> # [How Erdogan’s reelection will shift Turkey's foreign policy goals](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/628)
> 
>   
>   
> Having won Sunday’s runoff vote, Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/us-braces-another-erdogan-era-turkey) will extend his rule into a third decade with piles of foreign policy issues on his plate. The strategy that won him reelection and his desire to build a legacy will both require Erdogan to sustain and nurture the notion of a “strong Turkey” in foreign policy.
> 
> Normalization with Syria is the thorniest dossier, calling for drastic decisions. The return of the Syrian refugees — either forcibly or voluntarily — was a top issue on the campaign trails. Any progress there depends on not only reconciliation with Damascus but also the provision of living spaces to the returnees. A Turkish-Syrian deal alone cannot smooth the way for reconstruction. US and European objections will have to be overcome as well.
> 
> Earlier this month, Turkey and Syria agreed to continue dialogue toward normalization at a [four-way meeting in Moscow](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/first-turkey-syria-fm-meeting-russia-agrees-work-refugees-terrorism) involving Russia and Iran. Nevertheless, Damascus maintains that the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Syria is a precondition for any meeting between the two countries’ leaders.
> 
> **No immediate withdrawal from Syria**
> 
> Erdogan is unlikely to go for a withdrawal without crushing the de facto autonomous administration in the north led by Kurdish groups that Ankara sees as terrorists. He built his election coalition around the pledge of resolutely fighting terrorism and remains reliant on his nationalist partners to command the majority in parliament.
> 
> Also, Erdogan is unlikely to acquiesce to dissolving the Syrian National Army, an umbrella group of Turkish-backed rebel groups, or changing the status quo in Idlib, where the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham holds sway, until he gets what he wants at the negotiating table.
> 
> While US support for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) remains an irritant in ties with Washington, Ankara now has to reckon with another important factor: The Arab world has begun to rebuild ties with Damascus and is seeking to end Turkey’s military presence and curb Iran’s influence in Syria. Having readmitted Syria earlier this month, the Arab League tacitly denounced Turkey and Iran in its May 19 joint statement, rejecting “foreign interferences” and “support for … armed groups and militias” in Arab countries.
> 
> The Arab reengagement with Damascus could strengthen the latter’s hand in normalization talks with Ankara. Kurdish sources told Al-Monitor that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been encouraging Damascus — with tacit US approval — to integrate the SDF into the Syrian army as part of efforts to push back Iranian influence. Such moves clash with Ankara’s interests as well.
> 
> Erdogan, some observers believe, will seek to cast himself as an above-party national leader akin to Turkey’s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in what is expected to be the final stage of his political career. Such aspirations would require him to embrace diversity at home, but he could also pursue ventures nurturing the notion of a “strong Turkey” to build that image.
> 
> The strategies that Erdogan pursued to consolidate his electoral alliance rested on the narrative of a “strong Turkey” that has fought terrorism far and wide, developed its military industry including armed drones, manufactured its first electric car, discovered energy resources in its Black Sea waters, increased its power in the eastern Mediterranean, become a playmaker in the Caucasus by helping Azerbaijan reclaim territories from Armenia, led the creation of the Organization of Turkic States, stood up to NATO and the European Union to defend its interests, put Greece in its place and mediated between Russia and the West in the Ukraine war to prove its strategic autonomy. By flattering national pride, fanning national security fears and villainizing his opponents, Erdogan was able to avoid paying a price for Turkey’s economic turmoil, his government’s shoddy response to the February earthquakes and rampant allegations of corruption. This playbook dictates that the nationalism and triumphalism permeating his foreign policy should continue.
> 
> Erdogan’s quest to institutionalize his authoritarian shift was met with a popular objection that sent the presidential vote into a runoff but is unlikely to push him back to the democratic path. Any decision to heed rulings by the European Court of Human Rights and release scores of political prisoners would come as a huge surprise.
> 
> **EU membership a distant prospect**
> 
> Reviving Turkey’s membership talks with the European Union appears a distant prospect, too, for it would require the miracle of Erdogan reinstating check and balances, the rule of law and democratic norms. Still, Turkey’s worsening economic outlook, marked by an alarming foreign-currency crunch, requires continued partnership with the European Union. The flow of foreign portfolio investments to Turkey has all but stalled amid Erdogan’s controversial economic policies, with the central bank’s international reserves deep in negative territory.
> 
> Erdogan’s pragmatism dictates that Turkey makes the best of its position within NATO and partnership with the European Union. Having gained in spades from his double game between Russia and the West, Erdogan is unlikely to part with that policy. Moreover, he would not like to upset Russian President Vladimir Putin given the latter’s [economic gestures](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/turkey-elections-currency-fears-grow-ahead-presidential-runoff) ahead of the elections, including the postponement of Turkish gas payments. Putin gave Erdogan further political credit on May 17 when he agreed to extend the Ukraine grain deal that the Turkish leader had mediated. Economic interests — chief among them Turkey’s Russian-built nuclear power plant and the gas and grain trade — will continue to drive bilateral ties in addition to continuing dialogue on Syria and Ukraine.
> 
> Tensions with NATO ally Greece and the Greek Cypriots are unlikely to go away, given the importance that Erdogan places on the energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean.
> 
> But despite Ankara’s frequent rows with Western partners, those anticipating a rupture between Turkey and NATO have yet to prove justified. Having approved Finland’s accession to NATO in March, Ankara could well unblock the way for Sweden as well at the NATO summit in July. Yet, getting rid of the Russian S-400 air defense systems appears impossible for Ankara as long as its relationship with Moscow remains strategic.
> 
> **Closer ties with China?**
> 
> During his third term as president, Erdogan could dedicate a stronger effort to realizing the so-called Zangezur Corridor plan — a transport route that would connect Azerbaijani territories via Armenia and provide Turkey with a direct link to Azerbaijan proper — in a bid to solidify Turkey’s role in the Caucasus, gain access to the Caspian Sea and strengthen ties with the Turkic states in Central Asia. It would require normalization with Armenia, managing tensions with Iran and keeping up the dialogue with Russia.
> 
> As for China, Erdogan has largely stepped back from criticizing Beijing’s treatment of the Uyghur community and raised the prospect of Turkey joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization led by Russia and China. Despite Beijing’s wariness, he could press on for closer ties with the East.
> 
> As former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza put it recently to The New Arab, Turkey’s bridging role between West and East would continue but Ankara’s focus could now shift to “being anchored in the East and willing to hold the West, meaning Europe and the US, more at arm’s length.”

From this NBC News article, though, it sounds interesting:

> The two iPhones Raymond possessed — one personal, one for work use — were locked with encryption, and could be unlocked with a passcode or fingerprint. As is standard, the warrant allowed the agents to force Raymond to use his finger to unlock the phone. But courts have held that law enforcement can’t force a target to give up his passcode, because that would violate the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment ban against forced self-incrimination.

> Agents took the phones from Raymond after meeting him in the lobby of his hotel, but he had turned them off before handing them over. Accessing them at that point required the passcode, which the agents did not have. They went back to the hotel an hour later after consulting with a Justice Department prosecutor and told Raymond he was compelled to use his thumbprint to open the phones. But the agents failed to keep the phones from locking, so they went back a third time at the prosecutor’s urging, and Raymond provided his passcodes, allowing them to change the settings so they could continue to access them, court records show.

Just seems like a few moving parts:

* Are warrants even required for searches of government-issued phones?
* I'm struggling to follow whether this means that the agents got the defendant to unlock the phone with his fingerprint. It's not clear from the reporting, only that it was unlocked at some point but that the agents neglected to keep the phone from timing out.
* I imagine a lot will depend on the specific facts, not necessarily reported here by NBC.
* What's the good faith exception say when there *was* a valid warrant for the stuff on the device but that the warrant was executed in a sloppy, noncompliant way?

SAQQARA, Egypt, May 27 (Reuters) - Egypt unearthed human and animal mummification workshops as well as two tombs in the ancient burial ground of Saqqara, officials said on Saturday, marking the latest in a string of discoveries that the country hopes can help revive its vital tourism industry.

Mostafa Waziri, the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters that the two large ""embalming workshops"" date back to the 30th dynasty (380-343 BC) and the Ptolemaic (305-30 BC) eras.

The discovery was made after a year-long excavation near the sanctuary of the goddess Bastet, which is home to the catacombs of mummified cats in Saqqara, some 30 kilometres (18.6 miles)south of Cairo.

It was the same spot where hundreds of mummified animals and statues were uncovered in 2019.

""We found embalming workshops, one for humans and one for animals. We found all the tools that they used (in mummification) in ancient times,"" Waziri said.

Both workshops featured stone beds, clay pots, ritual vessels, natron salt, which is one of the main ingredients for mummification, and linens among other mummification instruments.

The Saqqara excavations also led to the unearthing of two small 4,400 and 3,400-year-old tombs nearby, belonging to two priests, Ne Hesut Ba of the Old Kingdom's fifth dynasty and Men Kheber of the late kingdom's 18th dynasty respectively.

Inscriptions of cultivation, hunting and other daily activities were found on the walls of Ne Hesut Ba's tomb while ""scenes showing the deceased in different positions"" were engraved in Men Kheber's tomb, officials said.

Egypt has carried out extensive digging operations in Saqqara and other ancient locations in recent years, which resulted in a number of high-profile discoveries.

The country plans to inaugurate the Grand Egyptian Museum, a state-of-the-art facility near the Giza Pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, after construction is completed later this year.

Egypt hopes it can further lure back tourists after the industry started to rebound of late, having been battered by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.

Tourism revenues climbed to $7.3 billion in the second half of 2022, a 25.7% increase compared with the same period a year earlier, according to recently released central bank data.",,"Egypt unearths mummification workshops, tombs in ancient burial ground",https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-unearths-mummification-workshops-tombs-ancient-burial-ground-2023-05-27/,reddit,jltquwe,"[[False, 35], [False, 95], [False, 91], [False, 69], [False, 210]]"

2491,">Technically, the Constitution Bench in the NCT case had left room open for changing the governance of Delhi. If Parliament were to pass a law, changing the governance of Delhi, and bringing all services under the control of the Union government, such a law might stand the test of legality, even if it were unwise. But by taking the ordinance route, the government has intentionally created a full-blown constitutional crisis.

>Admittedly, governments in the past have used the ordinance route to hand Parliament a fait accompli. But by taking that route, the government is cocking a snook at the Supreme Court. It is in effect saying: “We are using the purely technical possibility to negate everything you said about preserving the powers of an elected government in Delhi.”

>The Supreme Court will be damned if it does and damned if it does not. If it does not react to the use of this ordinance, it will send two signals. It will have failed to check the abuse of ordinance power of the Union government. There is no justification for bringing in an ordinance, when the government could have easily proposed legislation (however ill-advised it might be) in a few weeks’ time. Second, it will have put its seal on the disenfranchisement of millions of Delhi citizens. This ordinance is, without saying it, following the precedent of what it did in Jammu and Kashmir: Change the legal status of a state without any accountability whatsoever. The silence of the Court and all other political parties on Kashmir is coming home to roost. Whatever one’s views on Article 370, the unilateral downgrading of a state to a Union Territory should have occasioned judicial scrutiny and political opposition. “Federalism for me, but not for thee” is not a principle. The courts and the political system have conspired to produce this equilibrium.

>On the other hand, if the Court strikes down the ordinance, you have a full-blown war between the executive and judiciary. The executive will claim the mandate of the popular national will to delegitimise the judiciary. It might be the case that the purpose of this ordinance is not to urgently wrest control of Delhi. It may be to engage in price discovery about how much the government can put judicial power in its place, and get away with it. Either way, we are facing a constitutional crisis that could spiral out of control.",,"Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Brazen and ominous, Centre’s Delhi ordinance defies the Supreme Court, bodes ill for federal democracy",https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/centre-delhi-ordinance-supreme-court-federal-democracy-8619628/,reddit,jkw0elq,"[[False, 182], [False, 208], [False, 209], [False, 137], [False, 96]]"

if false flag -- it's not to give Russia an excuse to bomb Ukraine, they do that daily. They just did another cruise missile attack. No, it's either to use as an excuse for another draft (likely), or to excuse the use of nukes (less likely). 



I think this was an actual Ukrainian attack on a symbolic target which would have significant propaganda value. If it was a false flag, they would have been much louder about announcing it, and they'd have a propaganda blitz ready to go.

If he's guilty this will ruin his life.

If he's innocent this will ruin his life.

Regardless of guilt or innocence he will never be a police officer again, and will never recover from the media and public absolutely tearing him apart.

For his sake he is better off being found guilty, because if he's found innocent his life is ruined anyway.

What are the perks of that?

He has not been proven guilty or innocent, so why should he not receive his normal remuneration until a verdict is handed down?

There is a lot more to this than meets the eye, and this whole ordeal creates more questions than answers, such as

If he used excessive force did he have the correct physcological profile to be a police officer?

Did he receive the correct training for his job?

Should he have even been in that position to begin with?

While the actions of an individual fall on the individual, the blame isn't exclusively on that individual. There is a system, has that system failed? Has it failed the victim? Has it failed the accused?

The true story will eventually come out, but the story currently painted by the media is absolutely not the true story, and no one should be basing any opinions on guilt or innocence based purely on what they've seen on the mainstream news programs.","Clare Nowland, 95-year-old woman allegedly tasered at Cooma nursing home, dies",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-24/clare-nowland-dies-tasered-nursing-home/102389082,reddit,jlf5e2n,"[[False, 84], [False, 268], [True, 302], [False, 248], [False, 139]]"

The dildo of consequences rarely comes lubed.,"The downgrade from a rating of “buy” to a rating of “hold” is disastrous.  Any stockholders with any sense are selling now before it is downgraded to a rating of “sell”.  Frankly, it was generous of the rating company to only lower this stock to a hold.   Once it gets lowered to a “sell” the panic on Wall Street will drive the company into the ground.   If the executives at Bud Light and AB have any sense at all they will realize this by now, so their panic is understandable.  
Sadly, there are some people, some teams, and some companies that cannot stand success and even when they are number one, find a way to shoot themselves in the foot and loose it all.  Bud Light is a perfect example.","Bud Light parent company's stock downgraded by HSBC amid branding 'crisis,' huge sales drop",https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bud-light-parent-company-stock-downgraded-hsbc-branding-crisis-sales-drop,youtube,UgwVYnA_Zo3fx5A2g1B4AaABAg.9pZKZXeqPQ89pa7-HrQS2n,"[[True, 249], [False, 122], [True, 219], [False, 281], [False, 32]]"

Spying in one form or another has been around perhaps even before the times of Moses. It was just done differently at that time. 

>It has been suggested that the Twelve Spies that Moses sent to scout the land of Canaan, mentioned in the Book of Numbers in The Bible, might be candidates for the world’s first spies. But we know that spying was taking place much earlier than that. One of the earliest sources we have is the “Amarna Letters” from Ancient Egypt, which date to the 14th century BCE. They are diplomatic correspondence, recorded on clay tablets, that discuss among other things intelligence and espionage.

That Vanderbilt poll is heavily biased, look into who they polled and you’d find out, but instead you prefer to not take journalism seriously so you just read the headlines using only what agrees with your preconceived opinion on an issue. That’s called “confirmation bias” and channel 5 news suffers from it in the worst way. If you look at the so called polls that claim things like “90% support red flag laws” and then look at how many states have put this to a vote as a ballot initiative you’ll see that it often fails and when it does pass it’s by a bare minimum number of votes, often less than 1%, far from what some claim. 

The number of people in Tennessee that support such arcane laws as red flag laws and universal background checks are few and concentrated in the large cities like Nashville, Memphis. Go outside of these cities and you would learn this fact. The people that support freedom and Liberty, the 2nd  Amendment, and fewer gun laws, are those that work and don’t have the time to March around a capital chanting old, tired slogans, but we write, call and visit our legislatures constantly and encourage them to vote in the interest of the people of this state.

When my daughter was a baby and was fussing or teething or had an earache or whatever, I put my breast in her mouth. After a few minutes of nursing, she was out like a light. I even stuck my breast in her mouth right after she got vaccinations. Instead of crying, she would nurse and go to sleep. It worked great too when she awakened from nightmares crying (that awful stage of night terrors). And as a toddler, if we were out and she wanted to run around screaming, I gave her the breast and off to sleep she went. Instead of beating a child, how about redirecting them?

A recession corrects demand driven inflation because it makes people poorer and thus reduces demand as they have less money to spend. This isn't great but it's better than the inflation it corrects. 

We do not have demand driven inflation. We have supply driven inflation.

When the problem is that there's not enough to buy rather than to many people trying to buy it, all  a recession does is make things worse. You can't reduce demand for basics that people need so all you do is decrease living standards which is then compounded by the inflation you're failing to fix.

Not sure why people think China has any kind of control over Putin. The dude is a nutjob quite firmly in control of Russia with megalomanic dreams of restoring the Soviet borders.","Sometimes, Diplomacy requires being tactful and restrained in what you say or do in order to achieve a desirable outcome.  In short, diplomacy often involves exercising patience, restraint, and strategic thinking. China is the only country that can influence Putin in a meaningful way. There is no way the EU and USA can divvy up the $Trillions needed to rebuild Ukraine without a lot of pain to both, for generations. If China can see there is money to be made in reconstruction and that they could be a part of that 'Big Scheme' maybe they could be enticed to 'persuade' their  Russian friends to see the folly of their way. Ukraine will need dozens of Power Stations, Port Facilities,  Dams, Bridges,  Motorways, Railways, Steel Works, Airports and entire cities etc. and China is well experienced in all.  Decades of work. Getting China on board would be  a game changer for the war and would undoubtedly bring it to a quicker  conclusion. It may also distract China from the thorny issue of Taiwan, at least in the short term, by focusing their attention Westward and profit, which is really what motivates them.","Brussels plans to slap sanctions on Chinese companies aiding Russia’s war machine, Financial Times reports",https://www.reuters.com/world/brussels-plans-slap-sanctions-chinese-companies-aiding-russias-war-machine-ft-2023-05-07/,reddit,jjdxwn0,"[[False, 132], [False, 276], [False, 21], [False, 33], [False, 1021]]"

Yes, ChatGPT is machine-learning, not true AI. It is essentially Google Search with some word processing ability tacked on.

We're not in danger of AI. People are fearmongering primarily because they were aped by a competitor, and desperately want some form of regulation to be put in place that will limit their competitors while they try to catch up.

The damage these kinds of software can do are socio-economic: replacing jobs, decreasing amounts of employees needed to do a certain task, etc... But that's nothing new, nor is this fearmongering.

We would laugh today if someone suggested strict regulations limiting the use and sale of pneumatic drills, but guess what? They had a similar effect. Back in the day, you need an entire boat of indentured Irishman or Chinese immigrants to build a hole; now a few guys, a generator and some pneumatic drills gets the work done in the same amount of time for a fraction of the human cost.

Things like ChatGPT will displace labor from certain areas, and then new forms of labor will appear somewhere else. This is normal. It's a tool.","Can you at least say what the dangers are? Your title makes it seem like the guy was afraid of skynet. 

The A.I. doomer shit is insane. 

We are not close to a legit A.I. we have programs that we can build which have specific parameters of what they can process and do functionally. They aren't sentient. They don't ""know"" what they are doing. They are being told to do it and do it. No thinking or conscious understanding. 

The human brain cannot be replicated so far. When it can be then I will be concerned but we barely understand the brain as it is let alone enough to replicate it with wires and chips. 

Now, the concerns ARTICLE MENTIONS are something we should consider. The threat to jobs and misinformation.  


The job threat I'm not concerned with since every time we create new technology we end up creating plenty of jobs that cater to it. 

The misinformation is where my concern would be. However it's easily dismissed when you for example LEARN TO FUCKING READ THE SOURCES OF ARTICLES AND STOP TAKING PEOPLES WORDS OR ONLY READING TWITTER HEADLINES.

>but they are all really just a stochastic parrot

I think [this article](https://borretti.me/article/and-yet-it-understands) has a good counterpoint to this sort of thinking:

>These dismissive analogies serve to create a false sense of security—that if I can name something I understand it and know how it works and it is no longer a threat—and to signal to the listeners that the speaker has some revealed knowledge that they lack. But nobody knows how GPT works. They know how it was trained, because the training scheme was designed by humans, but the algorithm that is executed during inference was not intelligently designed but evolved, and it is implicit in the structure of the network, and interpretability has yet to mature to the point where we can draw a symbolic, abstract, human-readable program out of a sea of weights.","Am I the only one who thinks this is really dangerous and confusing clickbait? The AI tools which exists now are cool and all, but they are all really just a stochastic parrot. It's not some skynet general artifical intelligence. We're not near some AI singularity. The primary thing this is going to revolutionize in the short term is bad advice, misinformation, and scams, as well as the stock price of these companies.

3819,Her reasoning is bullshit and obviously a lie. Don’t give it any merit by even taking it at face value.,"my understanding tho is the three of them are on different parts of the spectrum. 

on the one end is sinema, who was a real progressive that ran as a democrat and then abandoned the party for gop donor money and switched to 'independent' in hopes of grifting both sides. 

in the middle is Manchin, a real republican who ran as a democrat and votes in line with republicans anyway. 

and then on the other end is tricia cotham, who is a real republican that ran as a democrat just to get elected and immediately switched to her true color(s) after winning. 

of the three of them, nc's cotham is the worst imo. sinema is a piece of shit but the fact she's now an independent tells me she's at least culturally more liberal than a racist/homophobic/misogynistic True Republican Shitbag(tm). 

but cotham is an actual awful, disgusting slice of human garbage, voting along GOP party lines for bigoted, hateful, repulsive legislation.

ETA: I looked into it. I don't know if I'm allowed to comments with links in this sub but wow. just wow. I don't know how but somehow the reality is *even worse* than my GOP plant speculation. she served in NC house from 2007-2016. she lost her primary running for congress, then ran again for state house in 2022. If she's telling thr truth, *she switch parties from dem to gqp because dems didnt clap during some recognition for her back on international women's day*.

It's a machine that can draw upon the world's knowledge and operate autonomously to serve some goal, where its ability to do so is increased with more powerful LLMs. It doesn't need to be perfect or even good at its job to cause real damage.

To be perfectly clear: I do not think there is a Robot God coming for us that will act of its own volition and decide to purge humanity, because [insert everyone's favourite arguments against AGI, sentience, etc]. 

What I *do* think is that LLMs encode the biases that they were trained on, and their unrestricted use will begin to expose and demonstrate those biases in ugly ways.
